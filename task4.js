let a =isNaN(11);
console.log(a);
// the output is false because 11 is a number value.
let b =isNaN(2-10);
console.log(b);
// the output is false because 2-10 is a number it has a calculation value.
let c = isNaN("hellow world");
console.log(c);
// the output is true because "hellow world" is a string value its not a number so the condition is true.
